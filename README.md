# Concurrent-Programming

# Author: Curtis Warren

This repository contains examples of concurrent programming.

##  Access Control App (threadexample)

 Description: This program defines the AccessControl class.
 This class ensures that only one thread has access to the important program resources.
 I have illustrated this with apples as an example of a program resource that should be kept safe when the
 program is running.
 
 ##  Writing Message App (helloworld)

 Description: This program uses threads to write three messages at the same time.
